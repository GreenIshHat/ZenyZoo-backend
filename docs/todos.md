Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd sequence things, balancing impact vs. effort for an MVP:

---

### 1. **Real-Time Game Flow (High ROI)**

* **WebSocket GameConsumer**
  *Why:* Instant feedback makes your game feel snappier and more ‚Äúalive‚Äù than polling.
  *Rough Effort:* Moderate‚Äîyou already have Channels wired up for chat, so move updates are a natural next step.
* **In-match Chat Integration**
  *Why:* Players love to trash-talk or cheer each other on. You‚Äôve built the chat consumer, just surface it in the match view.

### 2. **Polish & UX (Medium ROI)**

* **Mobile/Responsive Layout**
  *Why:* Even basic media-queries give you 80% of the benefit. Focus on breaking points and larger tap targets.
  *Rough Effort:* Low‚Äîstart with CSS grid/flex tweaks and a responsive meta tag.
* **Sound & Visual SFX**
  *Why:* A little flip sound + confetti on win goes a long way to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù good. You‚Äôve scaffolded sfx modules already.
* **Rematch Button**
  *Why:* Keeps the engagement loop tight‚Äî‚ÄúPlay again?‚Äù immediately after a game.

### 3. **Bots & AI (Medium‚ÄìLow ROI)**

* **Minimax/Alpha-Beta Tier**
  *Why:* You already have the RandomBot; wrapping in deeper search is a nice ‚Äúhard‚Äù mode.
  *Rough Effort:* Moderate‚Äîalgorithm work but little UI.

### 4. **Server-Enforced Timer (Lower ROI)**

* **Why:** Guarantees pace, but for MVP you can get by with a front-end countdown and a soft forfeit.
* **When:** Tackle this once your real-time WS loop is solid.

### 5. **Game Replays & Analytics (Lowest ROI)**

* **Why:** Cool for power users and demos, but not essential to your first public launch.
* **When:** After core loop + social/UX polish.

---

**Your Next Steps:**

1. Swap out polling ‚Üí WS for moves
2. Embed the existing chat into the battle page
3. Tackle responsive CSS (media-queries, touch targets)
4. Hook up SFX/confetti/rematch UX

That combo will give you a *super* engaging, immediate-feel multiplayer experience‚Äîstrong enough to show off on Product Hunt‚Äîbefore investing in heavier features like replays or strict server timers.

ü¶Ñ Zeny Zoo: Updated Task & Bug List (Priority Extract)
1. High-Priority:

    Bot Duplicate Plays

        Issue: RandomBot sometimes reuses the same PlayerCard twice per match.

        Action: Refactor choose_move logic to exclude already-played PlayerCard instances (not just by card type/ID).

        Verify: Commit the move immediately after selection to prevent duplicate picks.

2. Next-Action Sprint:

    Player 2 Stats

        TODO: Add accurate Win/Loss counters for Player 2 (both human and bot sessions).

3. Workflow/Infra

    Fix API vs Template URL issues (/game/api/...).

    Static files & CSRF for AJAX reliability.

    POST-based logout, proper login/register redirects.

4. UI & Game State

    Board polling: reflect all moves in near-real time (no F5).

    Dedicated ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù banner with winner highlight, freeze board on end.

    Animation: ensure flips update owner highlights on every change.

5. Multiplayer Testing

    Alice vs Bob: deck select, match, moves, end.

    Spectator mode: reload and verify real-time board updates.

6. Statistics/Profiles

    Human vs Human stats.

    Bot stats separated.

    Win/Loss/Draw counters increment at match-end, not before.

Immediate Focus

    Start with: Bot duplicate‚Äìcard fix
    Next: Full 2-player flow (Alice vs Bob), ensure stats update, polish UI
